## Reproduction Instruction

The reproduction for this project is very straightforward. 

First, navigate to the `SCRIPT` folder, where we stored all the codes and located which stock script you want to investigate, and the script for those stocks are symbolized by the naming convention as `stock_name.Rmd`. Because we have already included all the data that was used by the `Rmd` files within the `SCRIPT` folder, there is no data import needed. 

After we have opened the corresponing `Rmd` file, feel free to look into the code blocks and the corresponding packages that we used. Simply click `run` to reproduce the results.

Thank you!
